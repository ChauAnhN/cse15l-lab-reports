**Working Directory:** ```/home/lecture1```
This specific command gave no outputs because there wasn't a specific argument listed for ```cd```. In other words, there wasn't any path provided for ```cd``` to switch to, which provides the empty output in the screenshot above.

2. ```cd``` with a path to a *directory* as an argument.
