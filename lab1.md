**Working Directory:** ```/home```
This specific command gave no outputs because there wasn't a specific argument listed for ```cd```. In other words, there wasn't any path provided for ```cd``` to switch to, which provides the empty output in the screenshot above. This is an expected output.

2. ```cd``` with a path to a *directory* as an argument.

**Working Directory:** ```/home/lecture1```
By providing a specific path (in this case being ```lecture1```) for the command ```cd``` we changed the current working directory from ```/home``` to ```/home/lecture1```. This is why we received the expected output, ```[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$```.
